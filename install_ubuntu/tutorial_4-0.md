## Gazebo in different deb packages

Gazebo ships different Ubuntu debian packages following the [official packaging guidelines](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/). This changes brings an option about how to install gazebo:

 * Use Gazebo as an application: for the users that just run Gazebo simulator with the provided plugins and models and do not plan on developing on top of gazebo its own custom software. To use Gazebo 4.0, please install the package called ***gazebo4***.
 * Use Gazebo to develop software using Gazebo libraries: for users that develop plugins or any other kind of software that needs Gazebo headers and libraries. In this case, together with gazebo4 package, please install ***libgazebo4-dev***.

# Gazebo multi physics engines support

Gazebo is able to use different physics engines to perform the simulation.

[ODE](www.ode.org) is the one used by default, but support is in also in place for
[Bullet](http://bulletphysics.org) and [Simbody](https://simtk.org/home/simbody/)
using Ubuntu packages. For those users that wan to try [DART](http://dartsim.github.io/),
a from source installation of gazebo is needed, so please do not use the .deb packages.

## Gazebo 4 in ROS
